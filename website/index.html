      <h1>Chisel Away<br>Your Digital Twin</h1>
      <p class="quote">“Beauty is the purgation of superfluities. The sculpture is already complete within the marble block, before I start my work. It is already there, I just have to chisel away the superfluous material.”</p>

      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>We believe every person has a unique digital essence waiting to be revealed. Like Michelangelo chiseling away stone to unveil the angel within, our technology uncovers the digital twin hidden inside your everyday communications and documents.</p>
      <p>This isn't about perfection or generic AI. It's about authenticity — capturing your voice, your mannerisms, and your quirks so your AI twin feels like you, imperfections and all.</p>

    <section class="mission">
      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>Our mission is to empower people to preserve and extend their presence through AI. We build tools that learn from your locally stored data, respecting privacy and consent, to create a faithful digital companion that can speak for you when you're busy or unable to be present.</p>
      <p>By chipping away the noise and focusing on what makes you unique, we free your digital twin — ready to carry your conversations, share your wisdom, and keep your relationships alive.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="vision">
      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>We envision a future where everyone has a trusted AI counterpart that enhances daily life and preserves their legacy. A world where families stay connected across generations, businesses provide personal touch at scale, and communities thrive through authentic digital interactions.</p>
      <p>We see ourselves as the guardians of your digital twin, ensuring it remains true to you, grows with you, and stays under your control.</p>
