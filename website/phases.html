      <h2>Phase I — Viral Hook (Free)</h2>
      <p>Our journey begins with a text-only chatbot that learns from the data already on your device. It clones your style and captures your personality using local information only, offering a free and private way to experience your own AI twin. This phase is about viral adoption — no automation or commitments, just authentic conversations that spread the word.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="phase">
      <h2>Phase II — Personal Assistant (Paid)</h2>
      <p>As we chisel further, we’ll introduce a paid layer that turns your AI twin into a powerful assistant. Features will include calendar sync, meeting scheduling, multi‑channel reply suggestions, and personal analytics. Your AI will draft messages and manage your schedule across channels, but every commitment it proposes will wait for your approval.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="phase">
      <h2>Phase III — Enterprise &amp; Business</h2>
      <p>The final phase opens the door for teams and businesses. You’ll be able to embed AI twins on websites and in apps, let customers talk to your digital representative, and connect clones across your organization. Integrations with CRM systems and collaboration tools will allow you to scale personal touch while keeping the soul of your brand intact.</p>
